This is a React project bootstrapped by CRA utilizing D3.js to visualize an NBA player's BPM (Box Plus Minus) against their 2021-2022 salary.

The BPM stat as well as all of the salary and player data are from basketball-reference.com, and they have a great article about their BPM statistic here:
https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/bpm2.html

I put this application together to learn the fundamentals of D3.js and how it interacted within a React application, and used this as an opportunity to 
visualize whether or not there is a correlation between spending more salary on a player versus their overall impact on their team's success.


The app can be found hosted on Heroku here:
